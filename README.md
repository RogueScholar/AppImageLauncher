AppImageLauncher makes your Linux desktop AppImage readyâ„¢. By installing it, you
won't ever have to worry about AppImages again. You can always double click them
without making them executable first, just like you should be able to do
nowadays. You can integrate AppImages with a single mouse click, and manage them
from your application launcher. Updating and removing AppImages becomes as easy
as never before.

Due to its simple but efficient way to integrate into your system, it plays well
with other applications that can be used to manage AppImages, for example app
stores. However, it doesn't depend on any of those, and can run completely
standalone.

Install AppImageLauncher today for your distribution and enjoy using AppImages
as easy as never before!

## Features

### AppImage desktop integration

The core feature of AppImageLauncher is the so-called desktop integration.
AppImageLauncher allows you to integrate AppImages you download into your
application menu or launcher to make it easier for you to launch them. It also
takes care of moving them into a central location, where you can find them later
if you need access to them again. Furthermore, it sets up the update and removal
entries in the launcher for you.

### Update management

AppImageLauncher provides a simple to use update mechanism. After desktop
integration, the context menu of the AppImage's entry in the application
launcher will have an entry for updating that launches a little helper tool that
uses AppImageUpdate internally. Just click the entry and have the tool search
and apply updates.

### Remove AppImages from system

Removing integrated AppImages is pretty simple, too. Similar to updating
AppImages, you will find an entry in the context menu in the application
launcher that triggers a removal tool. You will be asked to confirm the removal.
If you choose to do so, the desktop integration is undone, and the file is
removed from your system.

### CLI

For automation, AppImageLauncher provides a CLI tool called `ail-cli` that
provides the most basic operations and can be used in scripts or generally from
the terminal in headless environments. As of February 2020, only integration and
unintegration are supported. More features planned!

## Differences between regular and Lite version

Starting with version 1.4.0, there's an edition of AppImageLauncher called
_Lite_. AppImageLauncher Lite is pretty much the best of AppImageLauncher you
can get without having root access to your computer. AppImageLauncher Lite is
shipped as an AppImage that can be installed by a user from the command line,
e.g. by calling `./appimagelauncher-lite...AppImage install`. The AppImage
integrates itself in the users' home directory then.

**It is highly recommended to go with the traditional packages _if possible_, as
they provide many more features and provide a much better overall experience.**

## About the project

AppImages and Linux desktops, that's two things which don't work together very
well currently. Since AppImages are normal executables, it'd suffice if desktop
environments like KDE, GNOME, Xfce, ... would assist users in making those files
executable, but as we learned recently, some desktop environments consider this
a security risk, and want to force users to use app stores.

Being executable isn't really all that is needed to provide a good desktop
experience. AppImages should be accessible from the application menus and
launchers. This so-called "desktop integration" can't be provided by the
AppImages themselves even though some AppImages ship with a "desktop integration
script" prompting the user to integrate the AppImages, as there's too many
impliciations that require an external software, especially regarding the
cleanup and removal of AppImages. Also, if applications are simply made
executable, they're still spread all over the users' personal files and folders.
The average user doesn't necessarily like a Downloads directory that is full of
AppImages with cryptic filenames.

Therefore, new, system-side solutions have been developed to perform the desktop
integration. The oldest available solution is
[appimaged](https://github.com/AppImage/AppImageKit), a daemon users can install
that performs everything in the background, automagically, without notifying the
user in any way. It scans a predefined set of directories including
`~/Downloads` and `~/.bin`, makes AppImages which are found executable and
performs the desktop integration. This is rather inefficient, as appimaged's
operations and monitoring produce a lot of file I/O. Also, many users don't like
the lack of control.

A new solution for native AppImage support has been developed: AppImageLauncher.
AppImageLauncher integrates deeply in the system and intercepts all attempts to
open an AppImage, becoming the first instance to handle all AppImage
invocations.

Being the launcher for AppImages, AppImageLauncher can control how the system
treats AppImages. It can perform the desktop integration, AppImage removal (also
called "uninstallation" sometimes, but as AppImages are not really installed,
this term doesn't fit very well), and could be used for many other tasks in the
future, like update checks and alike.

## Installation

### System wide Installation

AppImageLauncher is supposed to integrate deeply in the systems. Therefore, an
installation via native system packages is the preferred way to install
AppImageLauncher. This way, AppImageLauncher's package can perform the necessary
steps to have your system use it for all AppImage invocations.

Compatibility table (likely incomplete, please feel free to send PRs to add
distributions)

- Ubuntu trusty (14.04) and newer
  - **Important:** Ubuntu bionic (and newer) broke with the backwards
    compatibility of its `libcurl` packages, therefore users of these systems
    need to install the special `bionic` package
- Debian stable (jessie, 8) and newer
- Netrunner 17 and newer
- openSUSE Leap 42 and newer
- openSUSE Tumbleweed

The installation of packages on systems with a set of packages similar to one of
the listed ones (e.g., Linux Mint, Fedora, etc.) should work as well.

**Note:** For Ubuntu 19.04 and newer as well as derivatives, there's two PPAs
(personal package archives) available providing a simple way to install and
update AppImageLauncher (thanks [Peter Jonas](https://github.com/shoogle) for
creating and maintaining them):

- stable (provides all releases):
  https://launchpad.net/~appimagelauncher-team/+archive/ubuntu/stable
- daily (latest and greatest but possibly unstable):
  https://launchpad.net/~appimagelauncher-team/+archive/ubuntu/daily

Manjaro and Netrunner Rolling users can install AppImageLauncher with a
distribution-provided package called `appimagelauncher`.

Arch Linux, Manjaro, Antergos and Netrunner Rolling users can use AUR to install
AppImageLauncher by installing
[appimagelauncher-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/appimagelauncher-git)
(thanks @NuLogicSystems for setting up the build).

Other systems derived from the listed ones, such as for instance Linux Mint
(Ubuntu), should support AppImageLauncher as well. If they don't, please don't
hesitate to create an issue on GitHub.

**Note:** If your system is not listed above as supported, please feel free to
request support in an issue on GitHub. We can then discuss adding support.

### Build from source

Build instructions can be found in [BUILD.md](BUILD.md).

## How it works

AppImageLauncher is responsible for the desktop integration. When the user
launches an AppImage, the software checks whether the AppImage has been
integrated already. If not, it displays a dialog prompting the user whether to
run the AppImage once, or move it to a predefined location and adding it to the
application menus, launchers, etc.

## Technical background information

Details about how AppImageLauncher registers itself in the system can be found
on [this Wiki page](https://github.com/TheAssassin/AppImageLauncher/wiki/Idea).
